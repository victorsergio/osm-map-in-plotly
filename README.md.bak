# osm-map-plotly
Visualization of .osm maps as background with Plotly.



This is a lib to visualize an .osm map from the 
Interaction dataset (https://interaction-dataset.com/)
with Plotly.

The original file was designed to visualize an .osm map 
without the Lanelet library using MatplotLib.

This file contains minor modifications to the orginal source 
to make it compatible with Plotly.

The original source of this file can be
